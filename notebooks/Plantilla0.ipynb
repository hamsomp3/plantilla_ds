mínimo debemos saber:\n","-  Cuántos registros hay?\n","-  Cuantos atributos tiene cada registro?\n","-  De qué tipo son los atributos?\n","\n","Además:\n","-  Obtener una medida de centralidad para cada atributo\n","-  Obtener una medida de dispersión o desviación para los atributos que ésto tenga sentido\n","-  Calcular la matriz de correlación de los atributos de entrada para identificar atributos redundantes\n","\n","Como paso previo al preprocesamiento de los datos, debemos:\n","-  Detectar si hay datos faltantes (determinar en qué columnas y cuantos datos faltan en un mismo registro)\n","-  Detectar si hay datos atípicos\n","-  Detectar si hay desbalance entre clases\n","\n","Notar que en esta etapa no hacemos ninguna modificación sobre los datos, sólo estamos
